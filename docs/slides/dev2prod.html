# Development to Production, Quickly and Reliably.

## How to deliver value and eliminate distractions.
]
.right-column[
- **Version Control**: Issues and Documentation as close to the code as possible.

- **Platform**: Build for SaaS, because the benefits (except upgrades) transfer to deployed systems.

- **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.

- **Development**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.

- **Testing**: Automated integration tests, manual UI and performance tests, high code coverage(80%+).

- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment after testing passes.

# Version Control
"The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy. " - [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/codebase)

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Version Control: Git
]
.right-column[
- Branches should rarely be more than 1 level removed from master/develop.

- The master branch should auto-deploy to staging/testing servers on merge.

- The master branch should be protected from committing directly and only allow merges from approved Pull Pull-Requests.

- Feature and bug fix branches should be automatically deleted upon merge.

- Version control should feed into the Continous Integration pipeline.

- New features and behavior changes documented first (as design), automated tests, implementation.

# Platform
"Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments." - [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net)

# Dev/prod parity
"Continuous deployment is the idea that you push out changes to your code base all the time instead of doing large builds and pushing out big chunks of code." -    [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/2011/02/continuous-deployment/)

  ## Dev/prod parity
]
.right-column[

|  | Traditional app | 12 factor app |
|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Time between deploys | Weeks | Hours |
| Developers vs Deployers | Different people | Same people |
| Dev vs Prod environments | Divergent | As similar as possibe |


- **Make the time gap small**: a developer may write code and have it deployed hours or even just minutes later.

- **Make the personnel gap small**: developers who wrote code are closely involved in deploying it and watching its behavior in production.

- **Make the tools gap small**: keep development and production as similar as possible.

# Backing Services
"The code for a twelve-factor app makes no distinction between local and third party services." - (The Twelve-Factor App)[https://12factor.net/backing-services]

layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Backing Services
]
.right-column[
The app should be able to swap out a local resource such as a database with one managed by a third party without any changes to the appâ€™s code.

![Process Model](https://12factor.net/images/process-types.png)

- Borrowing from the Unix process model 
- By sharing nothing, adding more concurrency is a simple and reliable operation.
